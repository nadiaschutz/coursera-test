                    <p>deepPiXEL helps you to automate your customer support conversations through chat bots that learn from the conversations between your agents and your customers. At its core, we have built our technology from scratch, which gives us more control over how the technology works. It also makes fixing bugs and debugging problems much easier. Our technology allows the company to collect data on customer interaction and use that data to retarget advertising, and if the system is unsure of the answer to a question, it is able to pass the question to a customer service agent. We want to provide fast and accurate automated responses to your customers’ questions while lowering the number of support tickets and the cost of running the support team.<br>
                        <br> DeepPiXEL integrates with existing helpdesk solutions like Beam, Skype, Twilio, Intercom, Zendesk, Salesforce Desk and others, as well as social media such as facebook and twitter, texting, web forms, email and phone applications.<br>
                        <br>Partnered with the IBM innovation lab, University of Toronto (Department of Computer Science Innovation Lab), Google, Ontario Centers of Excellence and MaRs Innovation, deepPiXEL is on a mission to help our customers (ranging from small startups to large conglomerates) to enter into the new era of cognitive computing, enabling them to provide a better, more personal service to millions of customers and employees.
